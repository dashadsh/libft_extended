we must inform the operating system of our intentions with the 'open' function of the fcntl.h library. 
in this system call, we need to specify the path towards the file & 
the way in which we want to access it with flags.

the system sends a small non-negative integer called a file descriptor.
from now on, we use this fd to refer to the file, instead of its name.
our file might be assigned a number 3 or higher.

if we ask to open a file that doesn’t exist, or a file we don’t have 
the permission to open, fd is equal to -1
